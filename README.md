# Deep Learning-Wine Dataset Exploratory Analysis
I will be working with the Wine dataset. This is a 178 sample dataset that categories 3 different types of Italian wine using 13 different features. Then I will use machine learning to analyze the data and find the `common features` among the types of wines.
